# About Me

Hi — I’m Leanna, a GIS enthusiast and geospatial analyst who builds maps and tools that turn spatial data into clear, actionable stories. I work with open-source GIS tools, conduct spatial analysis, and create interactive web maps to help communities and organizations make data-driven decisions.

## What I do

- Spatial analysis and data visualization
- Web mapping with Leaflet and Mapbox
- Data cleaning and geoprocessing with Python (GeoPandas, rasterio)
- Cartography and map design
